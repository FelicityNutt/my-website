    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      Felicity Nutt (b.2000) is a British artist based in Staffordshire. She graduated with a Master's in painting from the Royal College of Art in 2024 and has since returned to her hometown in Stoke-on-Trent. Since her MA, she is proud to have shown her work quite widely, from places such as Portobello Road, London, to Ontario, Canada. 
    <p>
Painting is a slow endeavour for Felicity. In the digital age, where life can feel like a fast-moving carousel, she attempts to step off and find quietness in the studio. Working from the premise that ‘less is more’, she uses a limited colour palette and repeats simple forms, often a series of lines arranged as a grid. Delicate materials such as watercolour paint and coloured pencil allow her to build line and colour incrementally, encouraging a measured and reflective pace of working. Each step is considered carefully, with close attention paid to how change manifests itself over time.
    <p>
Her practice branches into two main projects. At its core is the making of charts, which involve introducing small, incremental changes to a single grid or surface at a time. This process allows her to focus on, and uncover, the full potential of one type of surface, resulting in a nuanced range of outcomes derived from the same starting point. The second strand of her practice explores binary relationships between surfaces, often drawn from these charts. Here, grids that would not normally sit beside one another are brought together to examine a broader range of contrasts. This shift in focus enables her to explore the space between two surfaces — how large, or how minimal, that space can be — and to test the intensity of the edge, pushing it to its limits.
